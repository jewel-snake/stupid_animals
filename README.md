This code disired to analize changing of genofond
of population. I will try to modify elements of model
by chance to make it more determined.
First version is very primitive: we assume that each round of
cycle population increaces constantly and new animals' 
parameters are set randomly. Animals always see each other,
so they always run and success depends only on animal's speed.
There are two types: preys and predators. Preys must run from
predators and their purpose to servive as long as possible.
Predators follow after preys and must eat enough to live.
